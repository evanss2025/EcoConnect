# Welcome to EcoConnect! ♻️

## What is it?
EcoConnect is a website that brings together communities to host and attend local trash clean up events to help the environment. 

## How does it work?
Users can add events too the map by typing in the name, address, and any links for their cleanup event. Then that is pushed to an Airtable database, which then finds the coordinates of the address, and the code runs a google maps api to add that location to the map. Since it is a database, the events will show up for everyone and will stay even if the user quits out of the website. 

## What was it built with?
EcoConnect is built using React JS, along with Tailwind CSS, Airtable, and Google Maps API.

## Reflection
EcoConnect was a super fun website to make. I was able to learn about Airtable and Google Maps API, while advancing my skills in React JS and Tailwind CSS. In the future, I would love to make the website more polished and useable for actual towns and communtities. This could include removing events, built in sign up forms, and more information on how people can help their local environment.
